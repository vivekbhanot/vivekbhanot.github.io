Intrigued by rapidly evolving role of data, from business by-product to world's newest resource for competitive advantage, I am deeply interested in being part of an organization which views data as corporate asset and is looking at either setting up from scratch or overhauling its information management system with an ultimate objective of deriving maximum value out of data.

I am open for business opportunities. Please drop me an email at [vivek.vb239@gmail.com] in case you want to engage for further conversation or you can find me on LinkedIn.
