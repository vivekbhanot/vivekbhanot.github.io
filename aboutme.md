Intrigued by rapidly evolving role of data, from business by-product to world's newest resource for competitive advantage, 
I am deeply interested in being part of an organization which views data as corporate asset and is looking at either setting up from scratch or overhauling its information management system 
with an ultimate objective of deriving maximum value out of data.

Solid banking experience in a dynamic emerging economy 
where I used my strong planning & execution skills to build & manage teams engaged in; 
framing & implementing award winning data management strategies and providing invaluable decision analytics to stakeholders.

I have proven expertise in assessing business requirements, generating options & implementing 
solutions with a keen eye on maximizing returns. 
Meticulous in my approach, I operate with a sense of urgency and thrive in a fast paced setting. 

I regularly deliver talks at conferences around the region sharing my knowledge & experience in areas like Data Governance, 
Data Warehousing, Business Intelligence, Business Analytics (Predictive Modelling), MIS & Reporting, CRM etc.
